The projects they build and the environments they build them in are becoming increasingly diverse and complex. It takes a variety of experiences, backgrounds and perspectives to succeed in this industry and cultivating those qualities in an inclusive environment has to be reflected in both values and practice. Visit any jobsite or company location and you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find an employee who can\u2019t cite Kiewit\u2019s Core Values \u2013 People, Integrity, Excellence and Stewardship. They\u2019re not just words. They\u2019re the guiding principles of how we do business and shape our policies and practices. Each one is a promise of accountability to ourselves, our employees, our clients and our communities. These values are the driving force behind our ongoing, proactive commitment to building a diverse, equitable and inclusive company \u2014 within every community and market we serve.\n\u2026\nShow more\nWork-life balance\nKiewit employees have access to a paid time off (PTO) program that allows for time and flexibility to take care of personal and family needs and gain the rest and relaxation we all need and deserve. Our Maternity Leave benefits start on the first day of employment. Additionally, we offer Parental Leave benefits for every kind of family, allowing all new parents to take time off to care for a new baby or newly placed foster child or adopted child. We also have private and well-equipped lactation room standards and break requirements for every office and jobsite to eliminate obstacles and unnecessary stressors for new mothers.\n\u2026\nShow more\nCareer growth and learning\nKiewit spends an average of $7,500 per employee each year on training and career development, well above the national average across all industries. The company also reimburses employees up to $5,250 per year in outside tuition costs with an approved program of study and satisfactory performance. Professional certifications and licenses are reimbursed at 100% of the employee\u2019s cost.\n\u2026\nShow more\nSocial impact\nThe communities we work in are our communities. Our employees live from coast-to-coast across North America, so we are often working in our own backyards. Charitable giving to multicultural health, education and workforce development organizations is just as important as the work we do building or rebuilding socially vulnerable or minority-based communities. We also understand that early exposure to STEM and the trades have a positive economic impact on our communities, so we work with schools, after-school programs and non-profits to engage and inspire young people with all of the opportunities this industry has to offer. Kiewit also contributes to many causes that make our communities better. We recognize the importance of supporting organizations that serve specific demographics from veterans to women and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). This includes grants to Urban Leagues, Latino Leadership Institute, Helmets to Hardhats, ICAN, Girls Inc., Boys & Girls Clubs and many other cultural, veteran and minority groups that educate, mentor and positively impact communities and groups in need.\n\u2026\nShow more\nLearn more\nTrending employee content\nPrevious\nNext", "About the company\nRoth Staffing\n131,985 followers\nFollow\nStaffing & Recruiting 501-1,000 employees 387 on LinkedIn\nMeet Roth Staffing:\nSimply put, Roth Staffing Companies \u201cmakes life better for the people we serve.\u201d Wanting to create a company of pride and purpose led to philosophies that soon became our Mission, Vision and Values.
