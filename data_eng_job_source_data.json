Our philosophy is: Find something you're good at, and do it better than anyone else.\n\nAverity's difference is simple: We provide an unparalleled experience for everyone we interact with. We believe in a culture of world-class service. We take pride in our integrity in the recruiting industry. This is not a boiler room and there are no cubes.\n\nPlease read our reviews on Glassdoor, Google and Yelp.\n\nAverity began out of the desire to create a different recruitment firm in New York City that not only provides the highest level of service to its clients and candidates, but also creates a positive team-oriented work environment where together everyone achieves more. The success is based heavily on the production of the team, not just the individual, creating a culture based on core values of Communication, Ethics, Innovation, Positive-Energy and Delivery.\n\nThere is a gap in connecting top tier talent within the Information Technology and Engineering sectors. As these industries continue to grow, the demand for a sophisticated web presence, monetization of data through business intelligence and a realizable return on online advertising will continue to increase.

In 2020, we proved to ourselves that we could adapt, work, and collaborate differently than we ever have before and still deliver some of our best work as a team.

This survey should take about 5 minutes to complete.\n  Form CC-305 OMB Control Number 1250-0005 Expires 5/31/2023\n Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Why are you being asked to complete this form? \nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\n Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.\n How do you know if you have a disability? \nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your \u201cmajor life activities.\u201d If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.

The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\n Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.
